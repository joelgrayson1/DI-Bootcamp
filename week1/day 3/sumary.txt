Data Structure (more complex) - Dictionaries

what is:
- an entry = a key value pair

How to:
- create (syntax) = {key:value}
- access key = dict_name[key]
- modify an entry = dict_name[key] = new_value
- add new entry = dict_name[new_key] = new_value
- delete an entry = use 'del' keyword
- access all the keys = dict_name.keys()
- access all keys and values = dict_name.items()
- add one or multiple key value pair: update()

#Advanced built in methods and keywords:

zip() = most be converted to an iterable in order to see the result

Continue: jump to the next iteration
Break: breaks the loops
Pass: placeholder - does nothing, organize the code
